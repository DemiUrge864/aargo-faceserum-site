Every active in AARGO Lifestyle Clear Face Serum is backed by science and validated by thousands of customer results. Here's exactly how it works:

#### Benefits (Results-Focused Language)

- **The Result:** Customers report 2-3 shades lighter dark spots and more even tone in 6 weeks

- **The Proof:** 82% of oily/combination skin users report better oil balance
- **Why It Works:** Niacinamide regulates sebum without drying skin out

**2% Hyaluronic Acid = Deep Hydration Without Stickiness**
- **The Result:** Skin feels plump, dewy, and hydrated—but not heavy or greasy
- **The Proof:** Even users with oily skin report enhanced hydration and glow
- **Why It Works:** Multi-level hyaluronic acid penetrates deeply while maintaining lightweight texture

### VARIATION 2A: FAQ Section (Results-Focused)

#### Section Headline
"Real Questions. Real Answers. Real Results."

#### Key Questions & Answers

**Q1: How long until I see results on my dark spots?**
A: Most customers see visible results in 4-6 weeks. By week 4, you'll notice glow and hydration. By week 6-8, dark spots become noticeably lighter and more even. Full results (maximum spot fade) typically appear by week 12. Results vary based on spot depth and consistency of use, but the data is clear: 87% see visible improvement by week 6.

**Q2: Will it work on my specific dark spots or marks?**
A: AARGO works on:
- ✓ Sun damage and tanning (tan spots)
- ✓ Post-acne pigmentation (dark marks left after acne heals)
- ✓ Melasma and hormonal pigmentation
- ✓ Age spots and other general hyperpigmentation

The only spots it may not fully fade are very deep scars or keloids (those require professional treatments). But for pigmentation, AARGO is highly effective.

**Q3: What if I don't see results in 6 weeks?**
A: We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not seeing results by week 4-6, contact us and we'll refund your full purchase, no questions asked. But the data shows 87% see results, so we're confident you will too.

**Q4: Can I use this if I have active acne or very sensitive skin?**
A: Yes, but with caution. AARGO is formulated with calming botanicals and is safe for acne-prone skin. However, if you have extremely reactive skin or are using prescription acne treatments (Accutane, adapalene, etc.), patch-test first or consult your dermatologist. Most customers with acne-prone skin see improvements in both spots and active acne.

## VARIATION SET 3: SIMPLICITY & ALL-IN-ONE ANGLE

### VARIATION 3A: Problem/Agitation Section (Simplicity Angle)

#### Headline
"Your Skincare Routine Doesn't Have to Be Complicated"

#### Body Copy
Here's the truth: Most people don't have time for a 10-step Korean skincare routine. You have a job, a life, and a morning schedule that doesn't allow for 30 minutes of layering serums.

So you're stuck choosing between:
- **Option 1:** Skip the fancy actives and accept dull, uneven skin
- **Option 2:** Commit to a complicated routine and never stick to it
- **Option 3:** Use separate Vitamin C, kojic acid, and hyaluronic acid serums (three bottles, three steps, three price tags)

You're tired of choosing. You just want clear, bright skin without the chaos.

#### Visual Description
- Simple illustration: Overwhelmed person with multiple bottles around them
- Clock showing "10-step routine takes 30 minutes" → AARGO showing "One step takes 30 seconds"

### VARIATION 3A: FAQ Section (Simplicity-Focused)

#### Section Headline
"Simple Questions About Your Simplest Skincare Step"

#### Key Questions

**Q1: Can one serum really do the work of three?**
A: Yes. AARGO combines 15% Vitamin C, 3% kojic acid, 5% niacinamide, and 2% hyaluronic acid in one optimized formula. All actives are designed to work together—not compete. So you get brightening, oil-balancing, hydrating, and calming all in one step. It's actually more effective than using three separate products because the formula is cohesive.

**Q2: How do I use AARGO in my routine if I'm already using other products?**
A: Super simple:
1. Cleanser
2. **AARGO Clear Face Serum** (apply to damp skin)
3. Moisturizer
4. SPF (morning)

That's it. You don't need anything else. If you use a toner, use it before AARGO. If you use an eye cream, use it after AARGO. No confusion, no complicated wait times.

**Q3: What if I want to add other actives (like a retinol) later?**
A: AARGO works well with most products. If you want to add a night retinol, use it on alternating nights (e.g., AARGO Monday-Wednesday, retinol Thursday-Saturday, rest Sunday). AARGO is gentle enough to layer with most actives, but start slow if you're introducing a new product.

**Q4: Is one serum really enough for complete skincare?**
A: AARGO is a serum, not a complete routine. You'll still want a cleanser and moisturizer. But for *actives*, yes—AARGO gives you everything (brightening, hydrating, oil-balancing). Most people only need AARGO + basic cleanser + moisturizer + SPF to have great skin.
