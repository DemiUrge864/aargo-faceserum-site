"Dark Spots, Uneven Tone, and Oily Skin? You're Not Alone."

### Body Copy
If you're struggling with any of these, AARGO Lifestyle Clear Face Serum was designed for you:

**Persistent dark spots and post-acne marks** that linger for months, making your skin look uneven and older than it is

**Dull, tired-looking skin** that lacks glow no matter how many products you use

**Tanning and uneven skin tone** from sun exposure, pollution, and hormonal changes

**Enlarged pores and excess oil** that make your skin texture look rough, even when it's hydrated underneath

**Sensitive, acne-prone skin** that reacts badly to harsh brightening treatments, leaving you stuck choosing between results and comfort

**Too many products, too little time** – you want one powerful serum that works, not a 10-step routine

### Visual Description
Optional: Simple icons or light illustrations showing relatable frustrations (mirror moment, calendar progression, concern about products)

## SECTION 5: DIFFERENTIATION SECTION

### Section Headline
"More Than Just Vitamin C: A Complete Clear-Skin Serum"

### Body Copy
The skincare market is flooded with single-active brightening serums. Most offer Vitamin C and call it a day. AARGO is different.

**Why AARGO Clear Face Serum Stands Out:**

**1. Multi-Active Formula**
One bottle combines Vitamin C, kojic acid, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and soothing botanicals. You get brightening AND hydration AND barrier support in one step.

**2. Designed for Indian Skin**
Most serums are formulated for Western skin types. AARGO is specifically designed for Indian skin tones, concerns (tanning, pigmentation, humidity), and lifestyle (outdoor exposure, pollution).

**3. Both Brightening AND Calming**
You don't have to choose between results and comfort. The combination of Vitamin C, kojic acid, and soothing green tea + aloe means you get powerful brightening without irritation.

**4. Lightweight, Non-Sticky Texture**
Perfect for the Indian climate. Absorbs quickly, doesn't feel heavy, layers beautifully with SPF and moisturizer.

**5. Daily-Use Safe**
Many brightening serums are reserved for nighttime or occasional use. AARGO is formulated to be used twice daily without irritation or sensitization.

## SECTION 6: FAQ SECTION (Objection Handling)

### Section Headline
"Questions About Using the Serum?"

### Q1: How quickly will I see results on my dark spots and marks?
Most customers see visible results in 4-6 weeks of consistent use. Dark spots become lighter and more even, with continued improvement over 8-12 weeks. Results vary based on spot depth and skin type, but you should notice glow and hydration benefits within 1-2 weeks.

### Q2: Is it safe for acne-prone or sensitive skin?
Yes. AARGO is formulated with both brightening actives and calming botanicals (green tea, aloe vera). The 5% niacinamide also supports barrier health. However, if you have extremely reactive skin, we recommend patch-testing first or starting with 2-3 times per week before moving to daily use.

### Q3: Can I use this serum every day?
Absolutely. AARGO is formulated for twice-daily use (morning and night). The balance of actives and soothing ingredients makes it gentle enough for consistent application without irritation.

### Q4: How do I layer it with my other skincare products?
Use this simple routine:
1. Cleanser
2. Toner/essence (if you use one)
3. **AARGO Clear Face Serum** ← Apply to damp skin, wait 1-2 minutes
4. Moisturizer
5. SPF (morning only)

Apply the serum to damp skin for better penetration.

### Q5: Will it make my oily or combination skin worse?
No. The niacinamide in AARGO helps control sebum production, and the hyaluronic acid hydrates without heaviness. It's specifically formulated for oily and combination skin types and won't leave a greasy residue.

### Q6: Is this suitable for men as well as women?
Yes. Dark spots, tanning, post-acne marks, and uneven tone affect everyone. AARGO is designed for all genders and skin types.

### Q7: What's the difference between AARGO Clear Face Serum and a generic Vitamin C serum?
AARGO combines Vitamin C (15%) with kojic acid (3%), niacinamide (5%), hyaluronic acid (2%), and soothing botanicals. Most generic Vitamin C serums offer only vitamin C. This multi-active approach addresses multiple concerns (brightening, hydration, oil balance, barrier support) in one step.

### Q8: Is this cruelty-free / vegan / clean beauty?
[Customize based on brand values]
